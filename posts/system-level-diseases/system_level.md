# System Level Diseases

## Introduction

- The importance of background models

## The Classical Paradigm

- Diseases classified as either infectious or non infectious
- This classification makes sense from a public health perspective â€” public health principles could be designed for the whole group of diseases
- This classification has been a highly successful model for characterizing and developing therapeutics for infectious diseases
- This classification was developed with only infectious diseases in mind. As a result, non infectious diseases was a catch all term. It conceals more than it reveals
- Saying that a disease is non infectious does not tell us anything much about the disease. Contrast this with the myriad of useful corollaries of saying that a disease is infectious. [Give examples]
