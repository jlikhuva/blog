# The Genetics of Neural Networks

## Abstract

Neural Networks exhibit state of the art performance on key Machine Learning tasks such as image classification and natural language processing. However, in spite of their widespread adoption and success, interpreting and explaining how these models function remains a challenge. Neural networks are, for the most part, black box models. In this work, we investigate whether experimental and computational ideas developed to understand cellular genetics can be used to understand how neural networks function. In particular, we draw inspiration from techniques used in Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to answer the following questions:

1. Can the weights of trained artificial neural networks be decomposed into functional modules?
2. Are these functional modules (if they exist) associated with particular traits or capabilities of the trained network?
3. Are these functional modules compositional? That is, can we recover the capabilities of the original network by combining these modules?
