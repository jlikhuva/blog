# Does New Physics Lurk inside Living Matter?

## Introduction

- Biological Systems are some of the most complex systems in the universe.
- Unlike in the older, and more mature natural sciences â€” physics in particular, Biology does not yet have something akin to fundamental equations
- Are biological systems amenable to such formal descriptions? If the answer yes, how would such descriptions look like?

## Why You and I Should Care

## Main Points

## My Synthesis & Questions

- Can we use insights gained from the study of other evolved systems, such as natural language, to better model biological systems? In particular, we know language to be both compositional and statistical. Can the same be said of biological systems?
