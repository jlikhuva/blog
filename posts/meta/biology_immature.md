# On the Immaturity of Biology: A Historical Perspective

- What do you mean when you say that biology is immature?
- What evidence do you have to support the assertion that biology is immature?
- Suppose that your assertion is true, or even partially true, why, do you think, is biology immature?
- What would the maturation of biology look like?
- Isn't this simply a call for more Mathematization of Biology? Do you recall Gunawardena's arguments against this?
- Ok, All right. How, do you think, the practice of biology will change once it has matured?

## Introduction

- Immature should not be read as pejorative. Simply means, not fully developed
- Cannot use young, because young fields can be mature. Biology is an Old, immature field
- Main reason is its complexity. Observational tools only recently available

## Evidence of Immaturity

## The Practice of Biology

- The practice of science
- New tools allow us to Observe new phenomena
- Painstakingly record observations (Elegant Diagrams)
- Patterns Emerge. Come up with theories to try and explain the patterns

## The First Great Infiltration

- observational science to experimental science

## The Practice of Biology before the First Infiltration

## The Practice of Biology after the First Infiltration

## On Mathematics: A Linking Digression

- What is mathematics: set of tools vs a language for expressing ideas
