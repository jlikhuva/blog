#### Introduction
I lied. We will not talk about Tries. We will, however, discuss two structures that are foundational to tasks that need to do substring matching: The Suffix Array and The Longest Common Prefix Array. We'll explore two linear time procedures (SA-IS & Kasai's Algorithm) for constructing these data structures given some underlying, fairly static string from some alphabet <!-- $\Sigma$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="../svg/pqSc9UzkQu.svg">.
