# Notes on "A New Perspective on Entropy"

## Introduction: Entropy & Topology

- Goal is to show that `entropy` and `topology` are linked through a rule similar to calculus' product/Leibniz rule.
- Entropy lives within `Information Theory`. Topology is a generalization of geometry.

## Entropy

- information and probability are inversely correlated. Observing a highly probable event does not give us much information.
