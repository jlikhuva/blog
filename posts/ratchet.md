# Ratcheting the Evolution of Multicellularity

## Introduction

- A ratchet is a device that allows motion in only one direction.
- During the transition from unicellular to multicellular life, how was multicellularity maintained. What forced previously unicellular organisms to *remain* within the group? What sort of ratchets were used to ensure that the unicellular -> multicellular transition only moved in one direction?

## Why You and I Should Care

- In cancer, transformed cells seem to break away from the body collective, so to speak, and revert back to their unicellular way of life.
- The cancerous, and associated normal cells, that comprise solid tumors often behave as if they are part of a new collective — a collective with a much smaller boundary than the larger body collective.

## Main Points

- It is theorized that the first steps towards multicellularity was the formation of cellular clusters.
- Most of these clusters would have failed to proceed any further. Within the few successful clusters, individual cells lost their evolutionary autonomy.
- Furthermore, the individual cells adopted traits that entrenched them in a group lifestyle.
- Such *ratcheting* traits stabilized the group and paved the way for the evolution of multicellular complexity.
- To recapitulate, the key problem in the transition to multicellularity is how multicellularity persists when the balance of selection tilts towards single cells.
- One solution to this problem is the evolution of traits that increase cell level fitness in a group context but reduce the cell level fitness when cells possessing such traits exist outside of the group as free-living cells.
- Ratcheting traits export fitness from individual cells to the collective. Furthermore, the more a trait makes cells in a cluster mutually reliant, teh more it serves as a ratchet
  
### Examples of Ratcheting Traits

- Increased Apoptosis (Programmed Cell Death). Enterocytes, epithelial cells that line the walls of the intestines, live for only 2 to 5 days.
- Division of labor. Within a tissue collective, only stem cells are tasked with regenerating the tissue — they have replicative immortality. All other cells either enter senescence or die, eventually. Within the body collective, only germ line cells are tasked with regenerating the body across generations.

## My Synthesis

- A key question not discussed in the article is, what caused those initial cell clusters to form? What sorts of evolutionary pressures selected for the trait of multicellularity?
- Extending this line of inquiry further, we can ask, how can we induce the formation of *organized*  collectives from (1) Biological cells (2) Artificial Cognitive Agents?
- Within those initial cell clusters, were the members identical? Probably not. It is more likely that there was a great degree of phenotypic variation among the different cells.
- How can we use the idea of ratcheting/stabilizing traits when developing artificial cooperative multi agent systems?
- If multicellularity was a necessary precondition for the evolution of complex traits such as neural intelligence, how should we update/refine our efforts to develop artificial cognitive agents in computer science? Here, I'm wondering if the dominant research direction that involves building bigger monolithic models may be sub-optimal.
