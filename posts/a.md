## A Call for a better understanding of causation in biology

> The substrates of life on earth are not the most interesting aspects of life. Life = Substrate (matter) + Information, but biology has over-indexed on the first while paying little to no attention o the second.

- Explaining the causal structure underlying the dynamic function f living systems is a central goal of biology.
- To attain our goal of rationally controlling complex living systems, we'll need to come up with efficient strategies to trigger desired system level outcomes.
- Currently, our understanding of living systems is extremely gene-centric. Biological processes tend to be described as a series of genes.
- We would, arguable, make more progress towards our goal of understanding the mechanisms underlying living systems by shifting out attention from the biological components to *patterns and dynamics of the connections between the components.*
- We need to change the point of view from focusing on the substrates to instead focusing more on the computations implemented by those substrates.
- Recall that by computation we simply refer to the general capability to acquire information, process information, store information, and transmit information.

> Life on earth evolved under a very narrow set of constraints. These included chemical constraints, gravitational constraints, electromagnetic constraints, among others.

- Constraints force a system into a specific differentiated state. Constraints, by providing the system with a deterministic output that would otherwise have been impossible to obtain act as organizing principles
- ... What we seek to understand are not the links between the individual grains of sand but the rules that link eventual patterns to constraints ... this would be a new model of causality wherein we focus on determinants rather than the instigators.
- We can operationalize such a model of causality in biology by:
  - Looking at the behavior of entire systems instead of only looking at causes acting at a single site and instigating downstream changes.
  - Shifting our focus from the study of molecular events to studying discrete pattern states.
  - Shifting from the old therapeutic design model (give me a target), a model that has been so successful at curing infectious diseases but has so far fallen short at helping us develop drugs for system level diseases, to treatments that put constraints on many parts of the system, sustained over time.
- Further, we need to shift from a search for conserved components to a search for conserved functions and control strategies. Such conserved functions may point us to fundamental mechanisms that life depend on.

> There is a fundamental difference between **what life does** and **what life is**. Further, there is a difference between understanding **how life does what it does** and understanding **why life does what it does**. Physics and Biology, in their present form, have helped us in generating rudimentary answers to the former questions. Answers to the latter, more interesting, questions, what life is and why life does what it does, still elude us.
