# The Biology & Genetics of Organisms

- Biology is the oldest scientific discipline. Before we gazed into the heaves and pondered about the nature of the stars, we cast our sights in our immediate surroundings and remarked at the great biological variety that surrounded us.
- We documented that variety, through cave paintings. Through exploration we discovered how to  harness some of the variety for food, for medicine ... Exploitation came before understanding.
- Documentation, recognizing patterns, then developing theories that explain the patterns.
- The biological revolution of the early twentieth century, a revolution precipitated by the infiltration of chemistry into the study biology, was {what was it?}
