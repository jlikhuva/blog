# At the Interface of Hubris & Humility

Hello! I an aspiring scientist working in Cambridge MA.

> Below, you'll find an assortment of notes and presentation slides that I made over the course of my independent study and work. Most of them are about _foundational_ ideas that lie at the intersection of the life and the mathematical sciences. I write these notes in order to _deeply_ understand the core ideas that animate these two areas of knowledge. I am distilling them here for future reference. While I have every intention to complete each set of notes, most of what you'll see here will remain incomplete for a very long time.

> If you find any bugs (errors or hard to understand sections) feel free to open a PR with the intended fix, or shoot me an e-mail. Finally, If it isn't obvious by now, this blog format was heavily inspired by [Frank McSherry's awesome blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog)

## Mathematical Sciences [WIP]

> A distillation of some of the most elegant ideas in computer science and mathematics. The collection is currently skewed towards ideas that showcase cool ways to design algorithms and data structures. Some of the links are to notes hosted on notion. Such links have been marked with an asterisk.

#### The Biology of Cancer: The Somatic Mutation Theory Perspective [WIP]

> Cancer research has been, perhaps, the most heavily funded research area in the past few decades. Even though this research has yet to translate into a, so called, cure for cancer, it has generated so many insights into the inner workings of cells and tissues. In fact, it could be argued that, almost all progress in the  field of Molecular Biology has resulted, directly or indirectly, from cancer research.
> There's no better 'introduction', in the sense that `CLRS` is an 'introduction' to Algorithms, to this field than Robert Weinberg's fine book, The Biology of Cancer (TBoC). That's why in 2021, I resolved to study TBoC in its entirety. In the following set of notes you'll find my synthesis of each chapter from TBoC, along with my notes on related papers and projects.
