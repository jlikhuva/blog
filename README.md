I am computer scientist working in NYC. 

Below, you'll find a random collection of notes that I made over the course of my study and work. Although most of the notes are about core ideas in computer science (Data Structures & Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, and Computational Geometry), a few are about ideas from Molecular Biology and Investment Science.  I wrote the notes in order to _deeply_ understand the foundational ideas in these areas of knowledge. I am distilling them here for future reference. If you find any errors, feel free to open a PR with the intended fix.

If it isn't obvious by now, this blog format was inspired by [Frank McSherry's awesome blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog)
