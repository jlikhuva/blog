Hello! I an aspiring scientist working in Cambridge MA.

Below, you'll find a random collection of notes that I made over the course of my study and work. Although most of the notes are about core ideas in computer science (Data Structures & Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, and Computational Geometry), a few are about ideas from Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics.  I wrote the notes in order to _deeply_ understand the foundational ideas in these areas of knowledge. I am distilling them here for future reference. If you find any bugs (errors or hard to understand sections) feel free to open a PR with the intended fix.

If it isn't obvious by now, this blog format was inspired by [Frank McSherry's awesome blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog)

##### Computer Science [WIP]

A distillation of some of the most elegant ideas in computer science. The collection is currently skewed towards ideas that showcase cool ways to design algorithms and data structures. Some of the links are to notes hosted on notion. Such links have been marked with an asterisk.

##### The Biology of Cancer: A Full Stack Perspective [WIP]

Cancer research has been, perhaps, the most heavily funded research area in the past few decades. Even though this research has yet to translate into, a so called, cure for cancer, it has generated so many insights into the inner workings of cells and tissues. In fact, it could be argued that, almost all progress in the  field of Molecular Biology has resulted, directly or indirectly, from cancer research.

There's no better 'introduction', in the sense that CLRS is an 'introduction' to Algorithms, to this field than Robert Weinberg's fine book, The Biology of Cancer (TBoC). Earlier this year (2021) I resolved to read TBoC in its entirety. In this section you'll find my synthesis of each chapter from TBoC.
