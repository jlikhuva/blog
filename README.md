Hello! I am scientist working in NYC. 

Below, you'll find a random collection of notes that I made over the course of my study and work. Although most of the notes are about core ideas in computer science (Data Structures & Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, and Computational Geometry), a few are about ideas from Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics.  I wrote the notes in order to _deeply_ understand the foundational ideas in these areas of knowledge. I am distilling them here for future reference. If you find any bugs (errors or hard ) feel free to open a PR with the intended fix.

If it isn't obvious by now, this blog format was inspired by [Frank McSherry's awesome blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog)

##### Computer Science [WIP]
A distillation of some of the most elegant ideas in computer science. The collection is currently skewed towards ideas that showcase cool ways to design algorithms, and data structures.

1. [`<O(n), O(1)>` RMQ in Rust](https://github.com/jlikhuva/blog/blob/main/posts/rmq.md)
2. [String Indexing: Tries & Suffix Arrays](https://github.com/jlikhuva/blog/blob/main/posts/string_indexing.md)
3. [The Bottom-up Splay Tree](https://github.com/jlikhuva/blog/blob/main/posts/splay.md)
4. Graphs: All Foundational Methods
