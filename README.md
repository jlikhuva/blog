Hello! I am scientist working in NYC.

Below, you'll find a random collection of notes that I made over the course of my study and work. Although most of the notes are about core ideas in computer science (Data Structures & Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, and Computational Geometry), a few are about ideas from Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics.  I wrote the notes in order to _deeply_ understand the foundational ideas in these areas of knowledge. I am distilling them here for future reference. If you find any bugs (errors or hard ) feel free to open a PR with the intended fix.

If it isn't obvious by now, this blog format was inspired by [Frank McSherry's awesome blog](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog)

##### Computer Science [WIP]

A distillation of some of the most elegant ideas in computer science. The collection is currently skewed towards ideas that showcase cool ways to design algorithms, and data structures. Some of the links are to notes hosted on notion. Such links have been marked with an asterisk.
